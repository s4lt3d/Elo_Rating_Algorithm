# Elo_Rating_Algorithm
Implementation of the Elo rating system for creating leagues for bots. It may be a little slow when ranking 100k bots, but the actual game playing is the bottle neck.  

This was created to help rank different sets of neural network weights against each other while evolving them to do a skill based task. The top performers then are saved and used to create the next generation of weights for the neural network.
